# Photo Exif Toolkit

Photo Exif Toolkit allows you to view or modify some Exif data of your pictures.

By the moment, you only can change the location to anywhere or change the date of the photo. And also you can copy and share the Exif data.

When you take a photo with your digital camera or phone, the camera writes technical information about the capture in the photo file and this is the [Exif](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exif) data.

The app is entirely written in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/).

The app follows MVP pattern. For more details read this [post](https://antonioleiva.com/mvp-android/).
